# Custom Portraits Texture Template

## Preparation
1. **Software**: Make sure that you have installed image editing software such as Paint.Net, Photoshop, GIMP or a similar application.
2. **Templates**: Download the default portrait templates to ensure that your textures have the correct dimensions.
   - The template was created with Paint.Net.

## Creating the textures
1. **New file**: Open your image editing software and create a new file with the dimensions of the default template or edit the template.
   - **Design**: Create your desired design. You can add patterns and other elements to make your texture unique.
   - **Save**: Save the file in TGA format.

## Inserting the textures into the addons folder
1. **Find folder**: Find your addons folder `Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns`.
   - Create a new folder here with a name of your choice.
   - Copy your textures into this folder.

## Loading the textures
1. **Add texture paths**: Add the paths to the individual textures in the game under `ElvUI > mMediaTag > Unitframes > Portraits > Textures & Style > Custom Texture`.

## Tipps
1. **Resolution**: The template has a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels so that the templates can be edited better. I have always saved the TGAs for the game in a resolution of 512x512 pixels to save memory space.
   - You can also leave the resolution at 1024x1024.
2. **Colors and shadows**: The frames and shadows are black in the template so that you have a better overview. When saving, I inverted the colors for these textures so that they are also white. This is necessary so that you can adjust the colors in the game. A black texture cannot be colored, it always remains black.
3. **Portrait area**: The section for your portrait should be about the same size as the green area.

Have fun creating your own textures! ðŸ˜Š
